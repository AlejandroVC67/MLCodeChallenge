 This class is in charge of building the service request.
 - How to use:
    First call the configureURL(searchType: SearchType) this will internally use the path that relates to the specific flow you want to use and format it.
    
    Then call the configure(httpMethod: HTTPMethods) indicating if you want to get or post information.
    
    Finally call the build function and you will have the request created and ready to use.
